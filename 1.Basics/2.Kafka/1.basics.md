### Use Cases of Kafka
- Asynchronous , if we have a requirement to create the wallet for a customer while creating an account, then for creation of wallet , lets say there is a different service all together which is taking care , instead of api which is two way communication , we can use kafka message to create wallet , this will help us to reduce the latency
- PACE matching service 1 , service 2, service 3 is sending messages at the rate of 10, 20, 30 messages/sec and consumer can consume at the rate of 10 messages per sec , this rate is managed by message queue, all the messages will put inside message queue


### Point to Point and Pub Sub
- Point to point where only one consumer can consume message , but in case of pub sub one message can be consumed by multiple consumer
