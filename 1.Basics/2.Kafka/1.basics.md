### Use Cases of Kafka
- Asynchronous , if we have a requirement to create the wallet for a customer while creating an account, then for creation of wallet , lets say there is a different service all together which is taking care , instead of api which is two way communication , we can use kafka message to create wallet , this will help us to reduce the latency
- PACE matching service 1 , service 2, service 3 is sending messages at the rate of 10, 20, 30 messages/sec and consumer can consume at the rate of 10 messages per sec , this rate is managed by message queue, all the messages will put inside message queue


### Point to Point and Pub Sub
- Point to point where only one consumer can consume message Think of it like sending a letter to one person. but in case of **pub sub** one message can be consumed by multiple consumer or subscribers


### Topic in Kafka
- Producer
- Consumer
- Consumer Group
- Topic
- Partition
- Offset
- Broker
- Cluster
- Zookeeper

- group of such broker is called as cluster and how these different broker communicate each other , it communicate with the help of zookeeper
- Kafka message is comprised of
  - < Key: string/Id > , < Value: {actual_message} > , < partition : {partition_value} >, < Topic: { Topic_Name } >
- every time consumer consume from any of the partition it keeps track of offset , every success message consumption will update the commited offset , lets say commited offset is at 3 and consumer is down , then consumer group will have another consumer to read the message , and offset will be used to pick up the message from where previous consumer left off

- In the above image we have topic 1 with partition P0 and P1 in broker 1 P0 partition is the leader and in broker 2 p0 is the replica or follower everything coming to topic 1 in broker 1 will be replicated to P0 in broker 2
- Leader will always be the responsible for read and write , in case of any failure of broker1 replica will start to server the read and write , Leader will always have the higher priority

### What happens when queue goes down
-  as we saw above , in case when queue goes down then replica or follower will be used to

### What happens when consumer goes down 
- when consumer for any reason goes down while reading any message, we first need to add some retry mechanism, even after retry mechanism it fails , then that message will pushed to failed queue or dead queue, and that message will pushed back to working queue again in order to process that message back
