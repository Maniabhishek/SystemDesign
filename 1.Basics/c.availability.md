### Node/Instance/Host
> - These three terms refer to the same thing most of the time: a virtual or
  physical machine on which the developer runs processes. Sometimes the word server also refers to the same concept


### Availability
> - The odds of a particular server or service being up and running at any point
  in time, usually measured in percentages. A server that has 99% availability
  will be operational 99% of the time (this would be described as having two nines of availability

### High Availabilty
> - Used to describe systems that have particularly high levels of availability,
  typically 5 nines or more; sometimes abbreviated "HA".

### Nines
> - Typically refers to percentage of uptime. For Example, 5 nines means an uptime of 99.999% of the time, below are the downtime expected to be in a year based on those 9's
>> - 99% (2 nines) : 87.7 hours
>> - 99.9% (3 nines): 8.8 hours
>> - 99.99 (4 nines): 52.6 minutes
>> - 99.999 (5 nines): 5.3 minutes

### Redundancy
> - The process of replicating the part of system in an effort to make it more reliable
