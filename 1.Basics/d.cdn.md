### CDN
>- A CDN is a third-party service that acts like a cache for your servers.
  Sometimes, web applications can be slow for users in a particular region if
  your servers are located only in another region. A CDN has servers all around
  the world, meaning that the latency to a CDN's servers will almost always be
  far better than the latency to your servers. A CDN's servers are often referred
  to as PoPs  (Points of Presence). Two of the most popular CDNs are cloudflare and google cloud CDN
