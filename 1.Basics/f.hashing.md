### Hashing
> - A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped
  when a hash table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to
  distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get
  forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when existing
  servers are brought down.
