### Pros of Increasing MaxBytes
- Improved throughput for high-volume topics:
   - Larger fetch size allows consuming more messages per request — fewer round trips to the broker.
- Can help when message sizes vary:
   - Prevents the consumer from getting stuck or doing too many small fetches when processing large messages.

### ⚠️ Risks or Trade-offs
- Higher memory usage:
   - Your application will hold larger message batches in memory. Ensure your service has enough heap/memory to handle it.
- Longer processing time per batch:
   - Larger batches might mean longer processing delays between commits, increasing lag risk if consumers crash before committing offsets.
- Latency might increase for real-time systems:
   - If MinBytes is small but MaxBytes is large, Kafka might wait longer to fill up the batch — possibly delaying delivery.
